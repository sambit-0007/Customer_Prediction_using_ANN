### About Dataset
    This dataset focuses on one of the central topics in customer relationship management (CRM): transfer of valuable customers to a competitor. 
    Customer retention rate has a strong impact on customer lifetime value, and understanding the true value of a possible customer churn will help the company in its customer relationship management. 
    Customer value analysis along with customer churn predictions will help marketing programs target more specific groups of customers. 
    The result of the case study show that using conventional statistical methods to identify possible churners can be successful.
### Identify the problem
    
    Due to different reasons a customer may leave the bank and can go for a competitor. From the dataset we can get the details whether the customer will leave the bank or not based on the features and can predict under which condition the customer leaves the bank.
    In this dataset we have 10 important features which basically helps us to predict whether the customer exits the bank or not.

### Expected Outcome

    The expected outcome of the dataset are
    * 1 = representing exit of customer
    * 0 = representing customer satisfied with the bank service

### Objective
    Since the labels in the data are discrete, the predication falls into two categories, i.e. Exit or staying. Thus, the goal is to classify whether the customer are leaving the bank or not. To achieve this we have used Deep learning classification methods to fit a function that can predict the discrete class of new input.
